SkyFront

========

SkyFront is a little project that I have had in my head for about a year.

Project SkyFront is going to be a weather based applicaiton that sits in a box an read weather information from another website.

It is going to be a little application that I am aiming to build up slowly over a period of me being in my new job
and using what I am learning.

FRONT END
=========
* Learn JavaScript
  ** AngularJS
  ** jQuery
* Learn more HTML5
* Learn more CSS3

TASKS
=========
* Use and create a range or graphics that show the types of weather.
* Look into HTML5 tutorials and CSS3 in order to get stuff outputted to the screen and style the page with the use of a flat UI type of design
* Look into the use of AngularJS that I already have a rough idea on and get dummy data pulled through in order to show a simulated weather condition that would be read from a website.
* Once happy with the HTML5, CSS3 and AngularJS working together, I will introduce jQuery in order to provide animations which gives the application a nice touch.

After this application has been created, I will work more and more onto making it better and maybe introduce some more ideas into it.

I also might have the application running on the AWS servers when I have also looked into having them working as well.
